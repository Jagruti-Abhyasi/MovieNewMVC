In our CreateCustomer Action method, here we simply returning a CustomerDto, which will response result like this (new customer data,
that we can see in postment output)
so status code of this response will be 200 OK and in the body we will have the customer object serialized as JSON but in rest full
convention when we create a resource the status code shuold be 201 or created
so we need more control over the response returned from our action and to make this happen instead of returning customer DTO
we're gonna return IHttpActionResult
// check Customer Controller - CreateCustomer

this interface is similar to action result we have in MVC framework so it's implemented bya few different classes and here in API controller
we have a bunch of helper methods to create an instance of one of the classes that implement this interface 

[HttpPost]
// change Customer to CustomerDto
public IHttpActionResult CreateCustomer(CustomerDto customerDto)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        return BadRequest;
    var customer = Mapper.Map<CustomerDto,Customer>(customerDto)    ;
    _contaxt.Customers.Add(customer); // now this customer object has an ID that is generated by the database   
    _contaxt.SaveChanges();

    customerDto.Id = customer.Id; 

    return Created(new URI(Request.RequestUri + "/" + customer.Id), customerDto); // here we need to specify newly created URL (Unified Resource Identifier)
    // so if the ID of our new customer is 10 the URI to this resource would be something like this (/api/customers/10) 
}
