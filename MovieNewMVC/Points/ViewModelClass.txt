In ASP.NET MVC, ViewModel is a class that contains the fields which are represented in the strongly-typed view. It is used to pass data from controller to strongly-typed view.

Key Points about ViewModel

1) ViewModel contain fields that are represented in the view (for LabelFor,EditorFor,DisplayFor helpers)

2) ViewModel can have specific validation rules using data annotations or IDataErrorInfo.

3) ViewModel can have multiple entities or objects from different data models or data source.

In our example, I created CustomerFormViewModel.cs class, because I need all membership type and customer detail 
for display on view. Membership and Customer are two different domain class.
