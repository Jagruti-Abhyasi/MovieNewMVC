While updating data on form if you don't want to set all property manually, you can use auto mapper

For example in our customer controller in Save action method, we need to set this
CustomerInDb.Name = customer.Name for all property

Auto Mapper is a convention base Mapping tool, so it looks at the property names of the source and target types
and maps them by convention, so instead of this four line your code may look like this

Mapper.Map(customer, customerInDb);

so it looks at the properties in customer object and then looks for properties with the same name in the target object
and maps them accordingly.

now to address the security issue, if you want to limit the properties of the customer that can be updated,
instead of accepting a complete customer object here you can create a different	class and call it
something like updateCustomerDto which stand for Data Transfer Object 
so it's a simple data structure which is a small representation of a customer with only properties that
can be updated and this way you can safely use a tool like	auto mapper to update all properties in that Dto to 
your domain object.

Note : Keep all your hidden field at the last and just before Button on html form.
