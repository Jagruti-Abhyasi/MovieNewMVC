<div class="form-group">
    @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Customer.Birthdate)
    @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Customer.Birthdate, "{0:d MMM yyyy}", new { @class = "form-control" })
</div>

From above code label display for Birthdate is Birthdate, what if we want it as Date of birth ?

Name of label is same as property name of the correspondig class.

Here we have two options, first go into the customer class and apply data annotation to birthdate as
[Display(Name="Date of Birth")]

Problem with this code is everytime we change our label, we have to re-compile our code

Second option is go to our view and instead of using LabelFor use manually label like
<label>Date of Birth</label>

But when we have LabelFor attribute and we click on label Birthdate , focus set on text box of birthdate. And when we added
label manually we can not set focus while clicking on label.

If we want to focus then we need to manually add for attribute like this
for="Birthdate", here is another problem when we change Birthdate property in our c# code this for="Birthdate" attribute
is nt going to change itself.

so it's up to you which one is used but for now we r going to use LabelFor helper method.
