1) we used Data Annotation on properties on our entities like [Required] [StringLenght(255)]
 to overwrite Entity Framework Convention

 2) EF uses data annotation to validate action parameters, so in CustomersController, in the save action here 
  we have customer as parameter 

  When asp.net MVC populate this customer object using request data it checks to see if this object	is valid
  based on the data anotations applied on various properties of this customer class,
 we can use ModelState property to get access to validation data.

 use this property to change the flow of the programme and if the model state is not valid then return the same view.

 3) add validation messages to our form (on view)

 This all are server side validation
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 Client side validation

 benifits : 
 1) User gets Immediate feedback, because they don't need to wait for round trip to the server

 2)No waste of server side resources
